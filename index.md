This is the public version of the 2020 remote syllabus developed for [Info 290M Lean/Agile Product Management](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/290m/lapm), a three-unit graduate class taught by [Jez Humble](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/jez-humble) at UC Berkeley’s [School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/). Everything in this document is copyright Jez Humble and licensed [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/) unless otherwise noted.

This course is designed to give participants a practical overview of the modern lean/agile product management paradigm based on contemporary industry practice. It covers the complete lifecycle of product management, from discovering your customers and users to release planning, economic frameworks, and managing teams. It takes an experimental approach throughout, showing how to minimize investment and output while maximizing the information we discover to support effective decision-making. This class is necessarily incomplete and does not cover product sales and marketing, product strategy, and pricing, amongst other topics.

This public version of the syllabus is designed for self-study and omits classes, some assignments, and guest lectures, all of which expand the syllabus. The website for this class, with details on grading and the most up-to-date syllabus for current students (including all assignments, classes, and guest lectures) is at [https://leanagile.pm/](https://leanagile.pm). There is a [reading list](#reading-list) at the bottom.
